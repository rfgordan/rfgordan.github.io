      <description>Teamfight Tactics, or TFT, is Riot’s entry in the “autochess” genre of strategy video games. Like Riot’s flagship game, League of Legends, TFT has a Ranked mode where players move up and down a “ladder” composed of tiers (Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger) and more granular numbered divisions within these tiers. This system exists essentially to make improvement feel more rewarding; “climbing” from plat iv to diamond i is more exhilarating than gaining 100 points of elo in chess.</description>

      <description>This is the first chapter of The Shepherd King, written as part of NaNoWriMo.
There is a tall mountain above it, and a glacier. But there are countless mountains in Anaria. Almost everything is in a mountain, or on a mountain, or in the shadows of mountains. It is in a valley, but nearly all the dwelling places of men in that land lie in valleys of some kind or another.</description>

      <description>During the pilgrimage season, which runs from December to March, hundreds of devout Sri Lankans nightly climb Sri Pada, or Adam’s Peak. The goal is to catch the mesmerizing sunrise from the summit. At the top of the peculiar conical mountain, towering above the surrounding terrain, lies a sacred rock said to hold the footprint of the Lord Buddha, or Adam, or St. Thomas, or Shiva, or a handful of other obscure candidates, according to the religious affiliation of the storyteller.</description>
