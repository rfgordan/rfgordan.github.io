    <p>During the pilgrimage season, which runs from December to March, hundreds of devout Sri Lankans nightly climb Sri Pada, or Adam’s Peak. The goal is to catch the mesmerizing sunrise from the summit. At the top of the peculiar conical mountain, towering above the surrounding terrain, lies a sacred rock said to hold the footprint of the Lord Buddha, or Adam, or St. Thomas, or Shiva, or a handful of other obscure candidates, according to the religious affiliation of the storyteller. Fortunately for travelers who, like me, don’t arrive in the December-March time frame, the trail is open year-round. And it is perhaps the off-season climb, rather than the traditional pilgrimage, that best tests the climber’s command of Buddhist virtues. It takes metta (benevolence) to maintain sanity while navigating Sri Lankan buses to reach the base, and upekka (equanimity) to stomach the strong chance that clouds will block the sunrise.</p>
<p>Sri Pada has captivated foreigners for thousands of years. Marco Polo and Faxian, a famous Chinese traveling monk, both mention the sacred mountain. Ibn Battuta, history’s greatest traveler, spent several days there. These days most visitors pass through Hatton, a small, bustling town that houses the nearest rail connection. At this point you can hire a tuk-tuk to Dalhousie, which lies at the most popular trailhead, for about Rs. 1800 (~$11). The budget conscious can head south along the main road to the bus station, where they may learn, as I did, that no direct buses are currently running, and they must first go to Maskeliya before continuing on to Dalhousie. The ride is somewhat scenic, if you can sit down, with the bus weaving between spindly reservoirs and tea estates displaying quaint English names. That’s lucky, because the entire process took me around four hours. The most frustrating delay came at the transfer in Maskeliya, where an attendant quickly shepherded me into the Dalhousie-bound bus. The driver and attendant waited for the bus to fill, and Sri Lankans have particularly extreme notions of what a full bus looks like. With young men hanging out the perpetually open doors and schoolkids stacked like jenga blocks, we finally set off. I gave myself a pat on the back for giving up my seat to an ancient man, but ended up locked into position with my ear adjacent to the speaker.</p>
<p>An hour and a half later, ears ringing with Sri Lankan pop music, I bought a spacious room for about ten dollars. A harder bargainer could probably pay less, because the village of Dalhousie (Nallathanniya) seems to be composed entirely of hotels and guesthouses, mostly vacant in the off-season. Also devoid of other paying customers was the roadside shack where I chowed down on the ubiquitous Sri Lankan fare of curry and rice, perched on a plastic chair of questionable structural integrity. Two other tourists who had been on my bus came up to ask if I wanted to join them for the ascent, and I eagerly agreed. In the shack several old women watched a movie raptly. “Alexander…” one of them said by way of explanation, noticing my interest. The handful of pixels on the tiny screen showed a white man in legionary Roman getup stalking menacingly towards a group of voluptuous light-skinned South Asian women. I paid and picked my way gingerly back in the dark.</p>
<p>At 2:30 AM I met my hiking companions on the bridge over the seetha gangula stream. The hike, though steep, takes only about two and a half hours for the reasonably fit. At the beginning, two separate monks try to entice donations, cleverly urging hikers to sign a visitor log with a column showing past gifts. I parted with 1000 rupees between the two, but given their doubtful affiliation with the summit shrine, you probably shouldn’t feel bad about keeping your wallet in your pocket. The gentle first section of the trail passed easily enough, and as we walked we admired the night sky and the peculiar way the moon hung with its crescent facing up, which I had never seen before. At a certain point you start to notice the looming shadowed conical mass of the peak itself, a shade darker than the sky and devoid of stars, impossibly close and impossibly high. I checked google maps and maps.me on my phone, but my blue arrow remained firmly planted in the village. How can the trail possibly reach the summit? The answer is that the “trail” morphs into a vertiginous concrete staircase. The odd shooting star provided entertainment for the frequent water breaks the steps demanded. In the end though, we managed to avoid serious obstacles. It never rained, and Sri Pada’s infamously aggressive leeches never made an appearance.</p>
<p>At 5 AM we joined the dozen other tourists huddled between the walls of the Buddhist compound, an hour to wait until sunrise. Here I discovered that the inner sanctuary, and the footprint itself, were closed for the off-season. I assuaged my disappointment and the creeping chill of the winds with a warm, sweet cup of tea from the complex’s caretaker. More hikers trickled into the summit area. On the right from the Hatton entrance you can find a small walkway that splits two buildings and ends with a good view to the west. I decided this was the best position to watch the sunrise and settled in to defend my real estate.</p>
<p>My reward came around 6, as the sun crowned the eastern peaks with a thin line of fire. In the gentle dawn light, the entire landscape slowly assumed its colors: blue for the reservoirs that filled the valleys, pale, motley green for the forest canopy, deep green for the twill of the tea fields, brown for the sheer cliffs and naked peaks, black for the outlines of distant mountains, hazy blue-gray for their mass, and shimmering white for the waterfall tumbling off a rock face to the southwest. At dawn the numinosity of the place seemed self-evident, elementary, universal. It no longer felt noteworthy that people of all the island’s religious traditions, and ancient writers from Greece to China, agreed on its sacredness.</p>
<p>If the first few moments of dawn were ageless, the next few were firmly modern, as all of us tried to capture the scene on our phones. Unfortunately for me, this futile effort never came close to replicating the moment.</p>
<p>Later, we walked to the western side, to watch Sri Pada’s shadow travel across the land. Except for a lone peak with a tilted tabletop, though, a sea of clouds dominated this direction. Nevertheless, we did witness the triangular shadow materialize shortly after sunrise, projected on the white of the clouds. It shortened rapidly before dissipating into the slopes of the mountains.</p>
<p>Leaving my companions behind, I hurried down to catch an early bus back to Hatton. An hour and a half later, I was back where my phone said I had been all along.</p>
